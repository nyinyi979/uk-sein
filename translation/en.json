        "card1": "Founded by U Thein Zaw and Daw Wai Wai Myint in 2004, Pantanaw UK SEIN began its journey with a deep commitment to preserving and promoting the art of traditional mat craftsmanship of Myanmar. Starting with mat production, the business has been dedicated to supporting local artisans and establishing a mat craftsmanship factory, innovating the traditional mat linning by hand to the machine. Building on this foundation, Pantanaw UK SEIN expanded its offerings to include a wide range of high-quality rattan items. Our dedication to craftsmanship and sustainability has positioned Pantanaw UK SEIN in the handcrafted goods industry of Pantanaw.",
        "card2": "The UK SEIN Online Shop was established during the COVID-19 pandemic as a response to the boredom experienced during lockdowns. Initially, the business began by casually posting photos of handmade rattan mats online. The positive response and increasing sales from these posts prompted a shift towards a more serious business start. As the demand for these products grew, the shop expanded its operations, focusing on creating a structured and sustainable business model.",
        "card3": "With the significant increase in sales through the online shop, the decision was made to open a physical store to further expand the UK SEIN. In addition to the existing product offerings, the store began selling rattan items and mats, which helped diversify the product range. To cater to specific customer needs, the business also introduced customised items, allowing for a more personalised shopping experience. Furthermore, the decision to market and sell furniture, particularly fiber furniture, opened new opportunities for growth. Eventually, the business started stocking and selling rattan chairs and tables, further enhancing its market presence. Currently, UK SEIN operates four physical stores in Yangon and has one additional store, along with a mat factory, located in Pantanaw.",
